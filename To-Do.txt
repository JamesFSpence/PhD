Contact Chris Hampson about being 3rd supervisor? 
Make list of dirty proofs in to do list
Look at thesis relating Analysis to hybrid systems
Think about 9 month review by end of April
  - Draft of chapters
  - eg. summary of the problem, definitions, background, literature review
Look into formalisations of algorithms
Read graph algorithms chapter Mohammad wrote

31/01
Prove union of TypeI regions has measurable cross section function

24/01
Write progress report

18/01
Come up with specification for region and boundary.
  - prove functions are analytically valid
  - combine only horiztonal and vertical division and existence of subdivision preconditions with the isoperimetric problem path assumptions (e.g well-parametrised).

03/01
Look at Green's Theorem proof and try to reconcile it with Isoperimetric Problem.

20/12
Ask whether I can use my own funding to go to Bonn event - i.e do they have office space
Apply to LMS funding


---- Non urgent tasks ----
Add theorem stating if function is cts, ge 0 and gt 0 at some point then the integral is gt 0 - using integral_eq_0_iff
Integral of intervals minus finite number of points are equal - typedef - transfer integrals to this type - Intervals form a semiring_of_sets!
Finish Interval.thy file
Using twice differentiable version of Green's Theorem that Mohammad intends to formalise

---- Dirty Proofs ----
