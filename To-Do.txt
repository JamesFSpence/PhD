----TO-DO----

05/02
Think about 9 month review by end of April
  - Draft of chapters
  - eg. summary of the problem, definitions, background, literature review
Look into formalisations of algorithms
Read graph algorithms chapter Mohammad wrote

31/01
Prove union of TypeI regions has measurable cross section function
Ask about a better way to do proof by cases (i.e not nesting proofs)

24/01
Write progress report

18/01
Come up with specification for region and boundary.
  - prove functions are analytically valid
  - combine only horiztonal and vertical division and existence of subdivision preconditions with the isoperimetric problem path assumptions (e.g well-parametrised).

03/01
Look at Green's Theorem proof and try to reconcile it with Isoperimetric Problem.

20/12
Ask whether I can use my own funding to go to Bonn event - i.e do they have office space
Apply to LMS funding

------------

Integral of intervals minus finite number of points are equal - typedef - transfer integrals to this type - Intervals form a semiring_of_sets!
Finish Interval.thy file
Using twice differentiable version of Green's Theorem that Mohammad intends to formalise
