----TO-DO----

Journal Club - 01/03 - decide on which paper to present

12/02
Accept School on Formal Mathematics invitation by 25/02

05/02
Write progress report
Isoperimetric Deadline - 19/02 - followed by literature review to decide on topic of PhD
Complete internship form
Make list of dirty proofs in to do list
Look at thesis on hybrid systems (sent on Zulip)
Think about 9 month review by end of April
  - Draft of chapters
  - eg. summary of the problem, definitions, background, literature review
Read graph algorithms chapter Mohammad wrote - Look into formalisations of algorithms

18/01
Come up with specification for region and boundary.
  - combine only horiztonal and vertical division and existence of subdivision preconditions with the isoperimetric problem path assumptions (e.g well-parametrised).

03/01
Look at Green's Theorem proof and try to reconcile it with Isoperimetric Problem.

20/12
Ask whether I can use my own funding to go to Bonn event - i.e do they have office space
Apply to LMS funding

---- Non urgent tasks ----
Add theorem stating if function is cts, ge 0 and gt 0 at some point then the integral is gt 0 - using integral_eq_0_iff
Integral of intervals minus finite number of points are equal - typedef - transfer integrals to this type - Intervals form a semiring_of_sets!
Finish Interval.thy file
Using twice differentiable version of Green's Theorem that Mohammad intends to formalise

---- Dirty Proofs ----
measurable_cross_section_typeI_div (and typeII analagously)
typeI_measure_function_induction (and typeII analagously)
