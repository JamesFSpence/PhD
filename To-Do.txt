The following review paper: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_2
--
Look at thesis on hybrid systems (sent on Zulip)

04/03
Got through notes on graph algos with Mohammad.

19/02
Look into time management training.
Look into formalisations of algorithms from graph algos chapter.
Write proof of Isoperimetric Theorem using notions in formalisation of Green's Theorem.

05/02
Isoperimetric Deadline - 19/02 - followed by literature review to decide on topic of PhD
Make list of dirty proofs in to do list
Think about 9 month review by end of April
  - Draft of chapters
  - eg. summary of the problem, definitions, background, literature review

18/01
Come up with specification for region and boundary.
  - combine only horiztonal and vertical division and existence of subdivision preconditions with the isoperimetric problem path assumptions (e.g well-parametrised).

20/12
Ask whether I can use my own funding to go to Bonn event - i.e do they have office space
Apply to LMS funding

---- Dirty Proofs ----
measurable_cross_section_typeI_div (and typeII analagously) (these theorems currently don't have any use)
typeI_measure_function_induction (and typeII analagously) (these theorems currently don't have any use)
