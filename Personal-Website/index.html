I studied my undergraduate at the University of Warwick where received my MMath. My PhD supervisor is <a href = "https://mabdula.github.io/">Mohammad Abdulaziz</a> and my research involves formalising Mathematics in Isabelle/HOL. I am also a member of the CDT: Centre for Safe and Trusted AI who's focus is on using Symbolic AI techniques to create trustworthy and safe AI systems. <br> <br>
